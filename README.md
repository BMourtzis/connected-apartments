### What is this repository for? ###

* The connected-apartments repo stores the server component of the Connected Apartments system built for UTS' SEP Subject. After the semester ended I decided to continue working on this project. The purpose of this project is to fix any bugs that exist, change the API to comply with any API standards that exist, create tests to test the system and lastly, expand the system to the idea the team had in mind.
* Version: 0.8
